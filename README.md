First generic repo about what I do built with Next.Js, Tailwind and DaisyUI.

This repo requires you to have npm to be installed. Please install node, if you haven't installed yet please read [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or
[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) for a tool version manager.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run to start local development

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

# Deploy

Vercel is the platform service provider to deploy our app. We shall go with barebone deployment without thinking too much about CI/CD which is handled all by Vercel. Simply install vercel globally as a cli or run an executable command with npx. Please read
[vercel-cli](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) for advanced options.

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

```bash
npx vercel
```

# View

A unique url should pop-up in your terminal for preview.
